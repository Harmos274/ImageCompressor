# Image Compressor
[K-mean algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) applied to image compression.
<br>

## Build
[Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) and [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) are used to build the project.

### Makefile
```sh
$> git clone https://github.com/Harmos274/ImageCompressor
$> cd ImageCompressor
$> make
```
<br>

## How to use it ?
```sh
$> ./imageCompressor -h
USAGE: ./imageCompressor n e input

	n		number of colors in the final image
	e		convergence limit
	input	path of the file containing the colors of the pixels
```
<br>

## Input Format
```sh
$> head exampleInput
(0,0) (33,18,109)
(0,1) (33,18,109)
(0,2) (33,21,109)
(0,3) (33,21,112)
(0,4) (33,25,112)
(0,5) (33,32,112)
(1,0) (33,18,109)
(1,1) (35,18,109)
(1,2) (35,21,109)
(1,3) (38,21,112)
```
The left column is the actual position of a pixel and the right column it's color.
<br>

## Tests (With Tasty and HUnit)

```sh
$> stack test
```
<br>

## Note:
I could rework the project for fun to allow `bmp` format. Not ***certainly***, but i could do it.
